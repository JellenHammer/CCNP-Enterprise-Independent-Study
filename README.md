# CCNP-Enterprise-Independent-Study
A repository for study materials, topologies, and notes in my studies for the CCNP Enterprise certification, covering Cisco ENCOR (350-401) and ENARSI (300-410) exam topics. This includes GNS3 lab simulations, practice questions, notes, and key concept summaries for routing, switching, security, automation, and network services.

Notes will be stored in the Repository Wiki Tab, while any files (eg. GNS3 Projects) will be stored in the repository Code tab.
